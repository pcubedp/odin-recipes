            <li>
                Place ramen noodles in a bowl. Set seasoning packet aside. 
                Pour boiling water over noodles until

            <li>
                Heat 1 tablespoon sesame oil in a frying pan 
                over medium-high heat, swirling to coat the entire pan. 
                Add chicken and stir to coat with oil.
                Add oyster sauce and 1 tablespoon soy sauce. Stir-fry chicken 
                until no longer pink and juices run clear, 7 to 10 minutes.

                5 minutes. Add ginger and 1 teaspoon minced garlic; 
                stir-fry until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer

                 garlic, and chili powder. Add ramen noodles; cook and stir
                 constantly until coated and water has evaporated,
